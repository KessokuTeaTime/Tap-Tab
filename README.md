# Tap Tab

**Tap Tab** allows player to cycle the hotbar through inventory. Double-tap the `⇥ Tab` key and see what happens!

Basically, double-tapping `⇥ Tab` moves all the lines of slots in your inventory down, including the hotbar. You can access the first line above the hotbar each time by doing this, and keep tapping `⇥ Tab` in a short period of time can cycle again without the need of double-tapping. After a cycle of 4 times, your hotbar will be in the original position again.

Holding `⇧ Shift` while tapping `⇥ Tab` will cycle in another direction, which enables you to access the first line below the hotbar(which equals to the third line above the hotbar) each time.

`⇥ Tab` can be configured in the `Key Binds` option page.
