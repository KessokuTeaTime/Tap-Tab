# Tap Tab

**Tap Tab** allows player to cycle the hotbar through inventory. Double-tap the <kbd>⇥ Tab</kbd> key and see what happens!

- Double-tapping <kbd>⇥ Tab</kbd> moves all the lines of slots in your inventory down with a fabulous animation, including the hotbar. You can access the first line above the hotbar each time by doing this, and keep tapping <kbd>⇥ Tab</kbd> in a short period of time can cycle again without the need of double-tapping. After a cycle of 4 times, your hotbar will be in the original position again.

- Holding <kbd>⇧ Left Shift</kbd> while tapping <kbd>⇥ Tab</kbd> will cycle in another direction, which enables you to access the first line below the hotbar(which equals to the third line above the hotbar) each time.

- Holding <kbd>⌥ Left Alt (Left Option)</kbd> while tapping <kbd>⇥ Tab</kbd> will only cycle the column where the main hand slot is.

All the keys mentioned above can be configured in the `Key Binds` option page.
