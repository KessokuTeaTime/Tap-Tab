# Tap Tab

**Tap Tab** allows player to cycle the hotbar through inventory. Double-tap the `⇥ Tab` key and see what happens!

Basically, double-tapping `⇥ Tab` moves all the lines of slots in your inventory down, including the hotbar. You can access one line above the hotbar each time, and keep taping `⇥ Tab` will move them again.

Holding `⇧ Shift` when tapping `⇥ Tab` just do it in another direction, you can access three lines above the hotbar each time.

The `⇥ Tab` key can be configured in the `Key Binds` option page.
